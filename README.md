# Task : Computational Statistics and Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project applies standard computational statistics and a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze a dataset. The key steps include:
1. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Computing statistical measures (mean, median, variance, etc.).
3. Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model.
4. Visualizing results and saving them as a PDF.

- Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
- Model evaluation using RMSE and F1-Score.
- Visualizations of:
  - Confusion Matrix (for classification tasks).
  - Residual Plot (for regression tasks).
