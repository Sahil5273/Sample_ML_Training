# Sample_ML_Training
# Task: Computational Statistics and Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project applies standard computational statistics and a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze a dataset. The key steps include:
1. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Computing statistical measures (mean, median, variance, etc.).
3. Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model.
4. Visualizing results and saving them as a PDF.

## Features
- Descriptive statistics calculation.
- Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
- Model evaluation using RMSE and F1-Score.
- Visualizations of:
  - Confusion Matrix (for classification tasks).
  - Residual Plot (for regression tasks).

## Dataset
**Dataset Name: Data.xlsv 
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project compiles purine content data from various published studies. These studies analyze purine levels in food products, including meats, vegetables, seafood, alcoholic beverages, and more.

### Data Sources
The dataset was derived from the following studies:
- Brul√©, D., et al. (1988). *Purine content of selected Canadian food products*. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 1(2), 130-8.
- Kaneko, K., et al. (2014). *Total purine and purine base content of common foodstuffs for facilitating nutritional therapy for gout and hyperuricemia*. Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 37(5), 709-21.
- Qu, X., et al. (2017). *Determination of four different purines and their content change in seafood by high-performance liquid chromatography*. Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97(2), 520-5.

*(Note: Full details of all sources can be found in the sheet 4 (Table4_Sources of data) of data.xlsv in this repository.)*
